## TheRosemaryProject - Contributing
In effect, the The Rosemary Project is in fact 3 projects:
- Rosemary - the language
- Sprig - the package manager
- the website
Right now, there are a few things to note:
- Some of the Sprig source code has passwords in and isn't released except in compiled code
- the codebase is a bit hard to read
So, back to contributing. Steps to do so:
#### Rosemary
- `git clone "https://GitHub.com/TheRosemaryProject/Rosemary.git"`
- the actual code is in SRC/CPP/rsmy.cpp
- you can edit this, then submit a PR
- Try to add code, don't refactor existing stuff
#### Sprig
- Contributions are very hard without passwords
- So we ask for you not to submit PRs, only issues
#### Website
- Not currently accepting PRs
