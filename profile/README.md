# Rosemary
## Like Python, but with brackets. 
- Basically: strongly typed, mix of python perl and php syntax
- It uses {} rather than indentation, as I think it allows for more options.
- Check out syntax.txt which I guess is also the docs?
- Extension is .rsmy by default but to be honest it doesn't really matter.
- .rsmy - Rosemary file
- Error checking is pretty good right now, not
- I'll try and fix that.
## Web Files Now Found [here](http://github.com/gonerogueproductions/rsmy-web)
## Why use Rosemary?
- idk
- general purpose?
## Plans for the project
- Change from Python to C++ for performance ✅
- I'll write my own interpreter, I won't use
Bison or Flex or whatever
- Interpreted for the time being, not compiled cos I don't know enough assembly
- Latest executable is at SRC/rsmy.exe
- You can compile for MacOS if you like
- Provide a command line argument to execute a file, else a shell will boot
- Also strings don't need speech marks, 
Rosemary does that for you
- I'll try to implement error handling as best
as I can, but you have to be careful with syntax,
in case catch clause is missing
- If you want to help, great! Make a pull request
or an issue or whatever :)
- Enjoy (or at least try lol)
